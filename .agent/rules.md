## Documentation Requirements

After making ANY code changes, you MUST update the relevant documentation files:

### 1. DEVLOG Updates
- **Backend changes** → Update `backend/DEVLOG.md`
- **Frontend changes** → Update `frontend/DEVLOG.md`
- Include: date, what was changed, files affected

### 2. FIXME Updates
- If you introduce a known issue or workaround → Add to `FIXME.md`
- If you fix an existing issue → Remove from `FIXME.md`

### 3. TODO Updates  
- When completing a task → Mark as `[x]` in `TODO.md`
- When adding new immediate work → Add to `TODO.md`

### 4. Code Comments
- Add `// TODO:` comments for incomplete implementations
- Add `// FIXME:` comments for known issues in code
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
```
feat(backend): add wayback scraper endpoint
fix(frontend): resolve 3D camera jitter
docs: update DEVLOG with latest changes
```

## Before Finishing Work

Always verify:
- [ ] Relevant DEVLOG updated
- [ ] FIXME.md reflects current issues
- [ ] TODO.md reflects completed/new tasks
- [ ] Code has appropriate comments
